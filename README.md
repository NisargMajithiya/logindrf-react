# Custom User Model and JWT Authentication System (Ongoing)

## Description

This is an ongoing learning project focused on understanding authentication systems in depth using Django REST Framework and React. The project implements a custom user model, login APIs, and JWT-based authentication, along with frontend handling using AuthContext.

## Tech Stack

React, Django REST Framework, Python, JWT, AuthContext

## Features

* Custom user model implementation
* User registration API
* Login API with JWT token generation
* Protected routes using JWT authentication
* Frontend authentication state management using AuthContext

## Concepts Explored

* Difference between default and custom user models
* JWT authentication flow
* Handling tokens on the frontend

* Understanding sessions vs tokens (in progress)

## Status

This project is actively being extended to explore session-based authentication and deeper authorization concepts.

## What I Learned

* Building authentication from scratch
* Managing users and tokens securely
* Connecting frontend authentication with backend APIs
* Structuring scalable auth logic for real applications
